			<h1>Fullfilling the Promise</h1>
			<p> Nancy G. Brinker promised her dying sister, Susan G. Komen, she would do everything in her power to end breast cancer forever. In 1982, that promise became Susan G. Komen® and launched the global breast cancer movement. Today, Komen has invested more than $2.5 billion to fulfill our promise, working to end breast cancer in the U.S. and throughout the world through ground-breaking research, community health outreach, advocacy and programs in more than 30 countries.  </p>

			<p>This football season, the Dallas Cowboys and Susan G. Komen are once again asking fans and supporters to join the promise that launched the breast cancer movement through the “iPromise” campaign.

CURE! to raise awareness for women’s health. Beginning October 6 during the team’s matchup against the Denver Broncos and lasting throughout Breast Cancer Awareness Month, fans were encouraged to HOPE! by getting educated about breast health, FIGHT! by participating with TEAM COWBOYS in the Komen Dallas Race for the Cure® and CURE! by purchasing iPromise merchandise, with 10 percent of its proceeds going towards breast cancer research.</p>
